Overview:
--------
Here lies Bonis, a project for Software Engineering at Cal Poly Pomona.

Bonis is a mobile web application for finding the best parties and group events nearest you. By
signing up with your Facebook profile, you can see all the current events and their reviews.

Technologies (Under the hood):
---------------------------------------
Originally implemented with plain Node.js/Express, the application is now using
the StrongLoop API Platform from the LoopBack framework, which runs on top of Express.

All of the front end is done with Bootstrap and the jade language, along with some
javascript, JQuery, and JSON to tie up loose ends and show events from our MySQL database.

On Running your own version:
---------------------------------------
1. Install Node.js
2. Install StrongLoop
3. Set server to run at localhost:8080
4. Run 'node .' in the Bonis directory

Done!
